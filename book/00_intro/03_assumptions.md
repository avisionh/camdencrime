# Assumptions
Before proceeding further, we should outline assumptions and/or caveats we are making in this analysis. This ensures there is the appropriate transparency and awareness of situations where this analysis will not apply.

1. Our sample dataset after removing missing values (makes up ~20% of our dataset) is representative of the original population data for crime. Thus, it will not impact drastically our analysis.
1. Population projections for Camden wards are close to current population numbers. Thus, our crime rates based on these projections are a good reflection of real crime rates.
1. Population levels in Camden wards do not change drastically within the same year. Thus, joining the yearly population data to monthly crime data is valid.

Indeed the counts of missing data in these two columns are the same and in the immediately previous plot, we find when `Outcome Date` is missing then `Outcome Category` is also. Interestingly, `Category` is not missing also."

    "We found that `Outcome Date` and `Outcome Category` are highly-correlated in terms of missing values, so if one column is missing a value, then the other column will also be missing a value. This means that if we remove rows with missing values from both columns, we will not be losing more data than if we just removed rows with missing values in one of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "20% of missing data in a column is quite alarming because it suggests we have a high proportion of missing data, which suggests the data collection process can be improved."

    "### Further notes\n",
    "Whilst it is unnecessary to dig deeper into the empty values for this dataset (we explored each possible column), if we had more columns with empty values then we could. in which case, we could use [dendrograms](https://www.displayr.com/what-is-dendrogram/#:~:text=A%20dendrogram%20is%20a%20diagram,to%20allocate%20objects%20to%20clusters.) to show the hierarchical relationship between objects - thus is mainly used for hierarchical clustering to work out the best way to allocate objects to clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of missing values, then this uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to bin columns by their correlation of nullity (which is what we saw in the heatmap) and then it tests how these groups of columns relate to themselves and so on...\n",
